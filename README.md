## 🏆 Features & Innovations  

### 📝 Core Note Management  
- **Add Notes** — Create notes with **Title**, **Content**, and **Category** (dropdown/text input).  
- **Edit Notes** — Update title, content, or category instantly with **in-place editing** (no extra popups).  
- **Delete Notes** — Remove notes you don’t need anymore in one click.  
- **Persistent Storage** — All notes are stored in `localStorage` so they stay even after closing the browser.  

---

### 🎨 Visual Differentiation  
- **Category Color Coding** — Each category has its own card color for quick visual recognition.  
- **Timestamp Display** — Each note shows the **date & time** it was created.  
- **UI That Speaks** — A clean card-based interface that feels intuitive and clutter-free.

---

### 🔍 Smart Search  
- **Real-time Filtering** — As you type in the search bar, notes instantly filter down.  
- **Title + Content Search** — Finds matches across the entire note, not just titles.  

---

### 💡 Bonus Features  
- **🌗 Dark/Light Mode Toggle** — Switch themes anytime, with your choice saved in `localStorage`.  
- **📌 Pin Notes** — Mark important notes so they always appear at the top of your list.

| **DOM Manipulation** | Dynamic rendering of notes and UI updates without page reloads. |
| **localStorage** | Stores notes, pinned state, and theme preference permanently. |
| **Event Handling** | For edit, delete, pin, search, and theme toggle actions. |
| **UI/UX Design** | Color-coded categories, timestamps, and a clean card layout for readability. |
